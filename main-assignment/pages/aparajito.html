      Aparajito (Bengali: অপরাজিত Ôporajito; The Unvanquished) is a 1956 Indian
      Bengali-language drama film written and directed by Satyajit Ray
      (1921–1992), and is the second part of The Apu Trilogy. It is adapted from
      the first half of Bibhutibhushan Bannerjee's novel Aparajito.[1] It starts
      off where the previous film Pather Panchali (1955) ended, with Apu's
      family moving to Varanasi, and chronicles Apu's life from childhood to
      adolescence in college.

        When Ray started making Pather Panchali, he had no plans of following it
        up with a sequel. The critical and commercial success of the film
        prompted him to start making Aparajito.[2][broken footnote] Unlike his
        previous venture, where he stayed faithful to the novel, Ray took some
        bold artistic decisions here, such as portraying the relationship
        between Apu and his mother in a very different manner from the book. As
        a result, in contrast to its predecessor, the film was not received well
        locally; Ray recalled that "as for the suburban audience, it was shocked
        by the portrayal of the mother and son relationship, so sharply at
        variance with the conventional notion of mutual sweetness and devotion"
