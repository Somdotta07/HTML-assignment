      The Salesman (Persian: فروشنده, romanized: Forušande, released in France
      as Le Client) is a 2016 drama film written and directed by Asghar Farhadi
      and starring Taraneh Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini. It is about a married
      couple who perform Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman on stage.
      When the wife is assaulted, her husband attempts to determine the identity
      of the attacker, while she struggles to cope with post-trauma stress.
      Farhadi chose Miller's play as his story within a story based on shared
      themes. A co-production between Iran and France, the film was shot in
      Tehran, beginning in 2015.

        The film premiered in competition in the 2016 Cannes Film Festival,
        where it won two awards—Best Screenplay for Farhadi and Best Actor for
        Hosseini. The Salesman was very well-received by film critics, who
        mainly praised Farhadi's direction and writing, and won the Academy
        Award for Best Foreign Language Film. However, Farhadi did not attend
        the 89th Academy Awards ceremony in protest of the U.S. Executive Order
        13769.
