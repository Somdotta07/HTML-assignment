      Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert
      Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel of the
      same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise,
      Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in
      the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted and kindhearted man from
      Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining
      historical events in the 20th-century United States. The film differs
      substantially from the novel.
