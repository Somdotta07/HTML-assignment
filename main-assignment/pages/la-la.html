      La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical comedy-drama film written
      and directed by Damien Chazelle. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a
      struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress, respectively, who meet
      and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. John Legend,
      Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock, and J. K. Simmons appear in supporting
      roles.

        Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle
        first conceptualized the film alongside Justin Hurwitz while attending
        Harvard University together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010,
        Chazelle penned the script but did not find a studio willing to finance
        the production without changes to his design. After the success of his
        film Whiplash (2014), the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment.
        Miles Teller and Emma Watson were originally slated to star, but after
        both dropped out Gosling and Stone were cast. Filming took place in Los
        Angeles between August and September 2015, with the film's score
        composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by Mandy Moore.
